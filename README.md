# Introduction to Programmability with python

Welcome to the "Introduction to Programmability with python" series. In this repository you will find a written version of the content covered during our technical fundamentals sessions.

This content is intended for you to follow along and try out. Programming is learned by doing so each section includes tips and tricks, common pitfalls and exercises with solutions for you to solve. 

> :warning: This is a common pitfall or warning.

> :wrench: Here you will find some background information.

> :computer: This is an exercises. They might contain sample code that you need to extend upon like this:
> 
> Modify the code so that it says hello and includes your name
> ```python3
> print("Hello")
> ```

For these exercises you will find solutions. You can view the solution by clicking on the text

## Sessions

### Introduction to Python
Python is one of the most popular programming languages of our time and the powerhouse behind most of Ciscoâ€™s API efforts. If there is a Cisco API chances are high that there will be a software development kit for that API in python. 

In part one of this two-parted training we will start from scratch and get familiar with the basic concepts of python like variables, loops and functions.

In part two of this two-parted training we will build on the basics from the last session to explore some more advanced data structures like dictionaries and sets. We will also get acquainted with some of the useful modules that come included with the python standard library. [Go to session](sessions/python_two/Readme.md)

### REST API Fundamentals
REST (Representational state transfer) is the most common API framework based on HTTP(S) and an essential part of Programmability. In this session we will provide you with the technical background on REST API as well as a practical introduction on how to consume and use REST APIs with python.
