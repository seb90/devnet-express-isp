# What is an API?
So what exactly is an API? The acronym stands for ***A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface*.

Academically speaking an API is 

> [...] a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of […] [an]other service.

In more down to earth terms:

> It’s a way for two pieces of software to talk to each other

So APIs allow us to have *machines talk to machines* instead of needing humans to retrieve information and then feeding them back to the machine. This kind of access enables a variety of use cases from monitoring and automating to delivering completely new products build on-top of others. 

In this capacity, APIs can have an not insignificant impact on innovation. Imagine every startup having to build their own *worldwide* mapping service instead of being able to leverage existing services and integrate or build on top of them. We would have far less startups and far less agility and innovation.

Need to be sold more? For infrastructure, APIs allow us to automate the boring tasks or personalize said infrastructure to deliver a experience that more closer solves a pain point. So API could also be an acronym for *Ability to Personalize Infrastructure* and who doesn't want personalized infrastructure without the added cost of personalizing infrastructure for each and every user? 

So how to implement this technically? We need a standardized way for machines to talk
that is both easy to use and powerful. This is what the *REST* standard is for and this is also the standard that we will explore in this session.
